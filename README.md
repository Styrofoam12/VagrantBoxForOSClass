# VAGRANT WOOO

My rendition of a Vagrant setup for my Operating Systems class at the University of Akron.

Instructions:

-Download and install Vagrant from http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

-Download and install VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

-Navigate to where this repo is downloaded to

-Type into the shell __vagrant up__ and watch the magic


-After everything installs (Should take somewhere between 5-15 minutes) close the VM and reopen
 using either __vagrant up__ or through the VirtualBox start button

-The standard login is user/pass: Vagrant/vagrant

-Enjoy!
